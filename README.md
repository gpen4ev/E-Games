## Connection String

Update the `DefaultConnection` string in the `ConnectionStrings` section of `appsettings.json` to match your SQL Server setup:

"ConnectionStrings": 
    { "DefaultConnection": "Server=your_server_name;Database=E-Games;User Id=your_username;Password=your_password;" }

```sh
"Logging": {

        "Default": "Information", 
        "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning", 
        "Microsoft.Hosting.Lifetime": "Information" 
    }
}
```

## Cloudinary Integration

To manage images using Cloudinary, add your credentials in the `Cloudinary` section of `appsettings.json`:

```sh
"Cloudinary": { 
    "CloudName": "your_cloud_name", 
    "ApiKey": "your_api_key",
